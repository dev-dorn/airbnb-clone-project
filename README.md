## 🗄 Database Design

**Entities & Key Fields**

- **User**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`  
- **Property**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`  
- **Booking**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`  
- **Review**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
