## üóÑ Database Design

**Entities & Key Fields**

- **User**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`  
- **Property**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`  
- **Booking**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`  
- **Review**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`

- Deploy updates faster and more consistently.  
- Reduce human error in deployment processes.

**Tools**  
- **GitHub Actions** for automated builds/tests.  
- **Docker** for consistent packaging.  
- **AWS/GCP/Azure Pipelines** for production deployment.
## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Provide a simple and intuitive booking experience.  
- Ensure responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- Prioritize accessibility (clear typography, sufficient contrast, alt text for images).  
- Maintain visual consistency (color palette, spacing, component styles).  

### Key Features
- Browse property listings with filtering and sorting options.  
- View detailed information for a property (photos, description, reviews, pricing).  
- Simple checkout flow to complete a booking with minimal friction.  

### Primary Pages
| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid/list of available properties with filters (location, price, date range). Shows property cards with images, price, and rating. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Provides in-depth information for a property: full image gallery, amenities, location map, reviews, and a booking button. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Guides the user through the booking process (selecting dates, confirming guest info, reviewing cost, payment). |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design
A booking system must be seamless because users are making **time-sensitive and financial decisions**.  
- A clear design reduces cognitive load and prevents abandonment.  
- Consistent navigation builds trust in the platform.  
- Fast, mobile-friendly UI improves conversions.  
- Visual hierarchy ensures the most important information (price, availability) is immediately visible.  
### Figma Design Properties

**Color Styles**
- Primary: #FF5A5F (Airbnb red/pink)  
- Secondary: #00A699 (teal)  
- Background: #FFFFFF  
- Text: #484848  
- Neutral shades for borders/dividers  

**Typography**
- Font Family: Sans-serif (e.g., Circular, Airbnb Cereal, or system fonts like Inter/Roboto)  
- Font Weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)  
- Font Sizes:  
  - Heading: 24px‚Äì32px  
  - Subheading: 18px‚Äì20px  
  - Body: 14px‚Äì16px  
  - Small/Caption: 12px  

### Why Identify Design Properties?
Design properties (colors, typography, spacing) act as a **design system**. They ensure:  
- Consistency across all pages and components.  
- Easier collaboration between designers and developers.  
- Faster iterations when making changes (update one style, propagate everywhere).  
- Scalability as the project grows.  
## UI Component Patterns

Planned reusable components include:  

- **Navbar**  
  - Contains logo, search bar, navigation links, user profile/login.  
  - Sticky on scroll for accessibility.  

- **Property Card**  
  - Displays image, title, price, rating, location.  
  - Clickable to navigate to the property‚Äôs detailed view.  

- **Footer**  
  - Includes links (About, Help, Terms, Privacy).  
  - Social media icons and contact info.  

Future components to explore:  
- Date Picker  
- Booking Summary Widget  
- Review Card
